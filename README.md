# Linear-regression
Linear regression is one of the easiest and most popular Machine Learning algorithms. It is a statistical method that is used for predictive analysis. Linear regression makes predictions for continuous/real or numeric variables such as sales, salary, age, product price, etc.

Linear regression algorithm shows a linear relationship between a dependent (y) and one or more independent (x) variables, hence called as linear regression. Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variable.The linear regression model provides a sloped straight line representing the relationship between the variables.

# Types of Linear Regression
# i) Simple Linear Regression:
If a single independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable, then such a Linear Regression algorithm is called Simple Linear Regression.
# ii) Multiple Linear regression:
If more than one independent variable is used to predict the value of a numerical dependent variable, then such a Linear Regression algorithm is called Multiple Linear Regression.
# Finding the best fit line:
When working with linear regression, our main goal is to find the best fit line that means the error between predicted values and actual values should be minimized. The best fit line will have the least error.
# Model Performance:
The Goodness of fit determines how the line of regression fits the set of observations. The process of finding the best model out of various models is called optimization.R-squared is a statistical method that determines the goodness of fit.
# Objective:
In this repository, linear regression (both simple and multiple) analysis have been performed on various datasets in python (Jupyter notebook).
# Packages used :  numpy,  pandas,  sklearn , matplotlib,  seaborn
